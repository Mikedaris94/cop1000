  - I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
  - I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
  - I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
  - I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
  - I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
1. Read about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), pay close attention to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=2MsN8gpT6jY) linked on the homepage and the part about [how it works](https://youtu.be/2MsN8gpT6jY?t=58s).
1. Create a new personal repository to store your web page, and title it YOUR-USERNAME.github.io.

# To Do List

1. Review FreeCodeCamp's [tribute page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) and [personal portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) projects. We'll base our project on these, but **it is not exactly the same**. Thus, you can complete those as a way to practice or get some help as you get ready.
1. Complete the project: [Your First Web Site](/docs/project1.md)
1. Create a web site that fulfills the following user stories:
  - I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
  - I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
  - I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
  - I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
  - I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
  - I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
1. Read about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), pay close attention to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=2MsN8gpT6jY) linked on the homepage and the part about [how it works](https://youtu.be/2MsN8gpT6jY?t=58s).
1. Create a new personal repository to store your web page, and title it YOUR-USERNAME.github.io.
1. Upload the files of your project into the `master` branch of your new repository. GitHub will automatically build the site on the `master` branch and serve your web page on `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.

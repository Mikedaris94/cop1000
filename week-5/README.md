# To Do List

1. Review FreeCodeCamp's [tribute page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) and [personal portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) projects. We'll base our project on these, but **it is not exactly the same**. Thus, you can complete those as a way to practice or get some help as you get ready.
1. Complete the project: [Your First Web Site](/docs/project1.md)
1. Ensure your web site has been publishe, and an issue has been created in the class repo as described in the project instructions.
1. Look for open issues labeled [project-1](https://github.com/cop1000/cop1000/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject-1) so you can help :eyes: over other students' projects.
